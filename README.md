# decentweb.eu
A overview of projects and protocols on the decentralized web.


# Next steps
* Write "who talks to who", detailing the protocols
* Draw a fancy graph overview of which projects use which protocols to talk to each other

# Working plan
This section is my notes on what I want this website to contain, and how to structue it. There will be unfinished text, cryptic notes and similar in the following. Comment in issues or contact me through my Mastodon account, if you want to comment or contribute: [@zatnosk@manowar.social](https://manowar.social/@zatnosk)

## Front Page

* Nav links to "who talks to who", "privacy", "detailed look at projects", "author's biases"
* Short notice on what the site tries to do + link to biases
* Fancy graph showing project logos, with protocols as colored lines
	* Short text describing protocols, what they are (language metaphor) + link to "who talks to who"
* Text on privacy + link to "Privacy concerns and tools"

## "Who talks to who"
A text on differences in the described protocols, what are their aims, what are their shortcomings

* OStatus
* Diaspora*
* ActivityPub

Should I include Zot and other (afaik) single project protocols?

[Someone posted a table about this on mastodon](https://manowar.social/users/zatnosk/updates/2097)
[Apparently the table was made by Mike Macgirvin](https://macgirvin.com/channel/mike/&f=&mid=a167ea295beeca0389a34a97c94c987765375a31fc49a090d8602278dbc319fc@macgirvin.com)

## "what project"
A page detailing each project, pros and cons.

* what do they focus on
* what are their aims

## Privacy concerns and tools
A text talking about the important of privacy, "herd immunity", etc.

* Link to Aral Balkan's Ethical Design manifesto + talks?

## Subpages for each project
Each mention of a project should link here

* Link to project's own presentation
* Link to find instances to sign up on

## Author's Biases
A page describing my biases and motivation for making this site.

* Talk about my vision for a decent social web
	* Decentralization
	* Selfhosting + coop hosting + corporate hosting
	* Try to minimize reliance on ideology, to avoid alienating people who happen to disagree with me
		* Argue instead based on a minimal and explicit set of values (axioms)
* What are my biases
	* Discuss how my values bias me on this topic
	* Discuss how my primary use of Mastodon + secondary use of Diaspora* bias me in looking at projects/protocols
